The Isle of Musica:
  story:
    - Voting on a mass scale is bound to be complex. And just like any complex system, trying out a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù way to vote is often too impractical to risk.

Imaginary Songs:
  story:
    - To solve such issues and first try out different scenarios, scientists often create basic rules for imaginary actors to follow in an imaginary world, then let the agents interact based on those rules, otherwise known as Agent Based Simulation. 
    - If we were to use Agent Based SImulation to test whether various voting systems lead to fair outcomes, we need to know who should be winning these contests. To do that, we need to define objective scores for each song. Of course, art and music have few objective qualities in the real world, but statistically speaking, we sample from a normal distribution, setting the objective score as the average. For the sake of this exercise, let‚Äôs say that the ‚Äúobjective‚Äù score of a song **equals** the average score given to it by all its voters. 
    - "**Select various songs below to see the ‚Äúobjective‚Äù scores used in this simulation.**"

Imaginary Voters:
  story:
    - Even though songs may be scored objectively, voters cannot vote objectively‚Äî meaning we must ensure we accurately simulate **subjectivity** among voters. 
    - We know that each voter's vote is never exactly the objective score. Most likely it's _close_ to the objective score, because voters are experts. 
    - The intent is to approximate nuanced differences in opinion among musical experts. If we assign two songs scores of 8 and 9, respectively, our simulated voters will often disagree on which is better.  But if we assign two songs with scores of 2 and 10, there should be less disagreement on which is objectively the better song. 
    - '_Basically: voters can agree on what‚Äôs a good song vs. a bad song. But when deciding which is best, and which is worst, there will always be personal differences._'
    - "**Click on the button below to see the subjective score around a selected song. Pick another song to see how votes reflect that song!**"
  takeaway:
    - In the simulation, You can see that voters all have differences. Many of them rate the song close to what it's worth, and some people are a bit off. Now what happens if thousands of these voters vote for songs with different voting methods?

Establishing a Baseline:
  story:
    - We use the _objective_ scores to determine which songs should fairly win the contest, and we use the _subjective_ scores to determine which song or songs a voter ‚Äúlikes‚Äù the best. Above are the songs that **should** win our contest. 
    - Now that we‚Äôve established the basics, we want to invite you to take a trip with us to the ISLE OF MUSICA, where we‚Äôll simulate various voting methods and see how they perform. ‚úàÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏èüéµüå¥

Song of the Year Contest on The Isle of Musica:
  story:
    - 'Welcome to the Isle of Musica ‚Äî an idyllic locale where every citizen lives, breathes, and eats music. The inhabitants of Isle of Musica are talented professional musicians, engineers, songwriters, and producers ‚Äî all with different expertises and genre focuses. They all coexist on the Isle of Musica in service of a collectively cherished value: their reverence, respect, and passion for music. In charge is Mayor Melody, who oversees the Isle to ensure all happenings and conflicts are resolved harmoniously.'
    - Everyone on the Isle can agree that both live and recorded music is something to be studied and taken seriously. However, it‚Äôs more difficult for Musicas to agree on which artists, albums, or songs are the ‚Äúbest.‚Äù If asked, they'd likely nominate themselves, a close collaborator, or someone of whom they are a fan. So in the spirit of wanting to give everyone on Musica their well-deserved props, Mayor Melody establishes Musica‚Äôs first annual contest for SONG OF THE YEAR.
    - Anyone who feels a song they wrote, played on, or produced within the year is particularly special can nominate it for the contest. num_voters people live on the Isle, and everyone voted. When Mayor Melody tallied the list of nominees, she counted num_songs nominated songs. 
    - 'Running a contest with this many entrants is undoubtedly tricky, but Mayor Mel has a plan. First step: instead of trying to declare one winner in one go, Mayor Melody decides the first round of the contest should be to determine a short list of finalists.'
  instructions:
    - This contest will determine a small list of finalists from the larger pool of nominees. How many finalists should there be?

Keep it Simple:
  story:
    - Mayor Melody, for the sake of ease, decides that each voter simply vote for which songs they think should proceed to the next round. With five finalists, each voter can vote for five songs.
    - Mayor Mel is a little overwhelmed at how many songs have been nominated, but she knows her citizens are dedicated and thoughtful. So she adds all the songs to the playlist on Isle of Musica‚Äôs .gov website and tells the island to start listening!
  instructions:
    - In this first contest, voters start listening to songs in the order they appear on the Mayor‚Äôs playlist. No voter has time to listen to every song. Each voter votes for their favorite num_winners songs they hear.
  takeaway:
    - In this ‚Äúshortlist‚Äù simulation, we see that when voters are shown songs on a ballot in alphabetical order, the songs that should win often do not receive the most votes.
    - Voters get more and more fatigued the longer they spend listening, and tend to best remember songs that begin with letters near the beginning of the alphabet. Note how the songs on the top of the ballot get more votes. This voting method is simply too impractical to be fair. 

Ensuring Fairness:
  story:
    - Mayor Melody wants to ensure that her citizens have the time and energy to judge each song fairly. So, she‚Äôs giving everyone the month off from work so the Musicas can properly listen and assess each song. She knows her citizens want to know who their competition is, so it‚Äôs important the voters submit an **ordered ranking** of all 500 songs. The ballots that Melody and her staff passed out were ‚Äî very long, to put it kindly!
  instructions:
    - Hit ‚Äúsimulate‚Äù as many times as you want to see who is presented as the winner when all num_voters voters rank num_songs songs. 
    # - In order to ensure a fair outcome, in this contest, all num_voters voters listen and vote on all num_songs songs. If every song were three and half minutes long, it would take total_time_str to listen to all of them continuously.
  takeaway:
    - In this simulation you‚Äôll notice that when all num_voters citizens of Musica all listen to every song‚Äîeven with voter subjectivity‚Äî their collective wisdom almost always picks the best songs. 
    - _If only_ voters in the real world had ample downtime and endless patience to rank num_songs songs. 

    # - In this simulation, Even when voters are pretty subjective, when they all listen to every song, their collective wisdom almost always picks the best songs. But this is not feasible in real life!

The Power of Randomness:
  story:
  - Instead of withholding precious recording, production, and engineering hours from her citizens, Mayor Melody has decided to unveil a more time-efficient plan to ensure a fair election. Yes, there are a lot of songs to listen to ‚Äî but there are also **twice as many educated**, committed voters who will take the time to thoughtfully and expertly vote on songs. 
  - Now, instead of every voter receiving all num_songs songs, Mayor Melody has decided that each citizen will instead be sent a **randomly chosen subset of ballot_limit songs** to rank. Since the latest technology takes awhile to make it out to the Isle. Mayor Melody was worried voters wouldn‚Äôt have room for all num_songs songs on their Zunes. This will be much more practical for them.
  instructions:
    - In our third contest, voters are randomly assigned a smaller subset of songs to listen to. They then submit a ballot ranking their top picks from that sample. Change the listening sample and ballot sizes to explore different outcomes.
  takeaway:
    - In this simulation, we see that while voters may only vote for a small subset of songs, the votes, far more often than not, reflect the songs that should ‚Äúobjectively‚Äù win. Even with each voter assigned only 50 songs, with 1000 voters, each song is heard by, on average, 100 people.

Nullifying Bloc Voting:
  story:
    - While making her rounds in the town square, Mayor Melody gets a whiff that individual loyalties might threaten to throw off the otherwise fair Song of the Year contest. For example, in Double Reed Village, Al Pacone was running a campaign to get people to vote for his buddy Kid Lincoln's song, "Defenestration", by offering them a free session at his state-of-the-art studio. And Lucky Luke, over on the Cul de Sousa Sac, told his neighbors that if they voted for his song, "Entrepreneur," he‚Äôd do them a big musical favor at a later date.
    - Mayor Melody must mitigate this issue and ensure a voting system in which no individual can successful skew the final results. Use the sliders below to see how much ‚Äîor how little‚Äî cronyism affects the final result of the contest when we enable The Power of Randomness 
  instructions:
    - In our last contest, members of a corrupt voting bloc will rank their leader's song at the top of the ballot no matter what, contorting the results. The corrupt songs are good but not great ‚Äì about a B+. They're¬†not bad, but shouldn't count among finalists.
  takeaway:
    - The results of this simulation are surprisingly similar to the one before it. Even when every single voter is in cahoots with someone else, the randomization of the contest prevents coordination ‚Äì not enough of them get the chance to vote for their ring leader. 
    - By _not_ voting for the deserved best song, and promoting a corrupt song to the finalists, this opens up the chance for a near-finalist to become a finalist. This phenomenon conveniently nullifies any attempts at collusion. 

Conclusion:
  story:
    - 'The citizens of Isle of Musica are pleased with the final system for their SONG OF THE YEAR contest. With this newly introduced voting system:'
    - 1. The results feel fair to everyone ‚Äî songs two thirds of the way down the ballot are deservedly making it into the list of finalists when using ‚ÄúThe Power of Randomness‚Äù method.
    # -     AND
    - 2. Citizens of the Isle could reach this fair outcome while each only listening to 10% of the total songs, leaving them more time to engineer sounds, produce new music, and get inspired to record more. Voter fatigue was nearly eliminated! 
    - Once the SONG OF THE YEAR contest was complete, the citizens of Musica felt recognized by their peers for their efforts and contributions to their Musical community. And in the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter who won the contest, because they know that the real winner here is the expertise and passion of their harmonious community.

Some Notes on Simulations:
  story:
    - 'Scientists commonly turn to agent based simulations for help solving complex problems. Agent based simulations are simple to set up but the outputs can be complex and informative. The process is simple: first, you define the logic for how agents interact. Then you let them interact and observe the results. By connecting specific inputs to changing outputs, simulations help us understand how opaque phenomena behave and what control we could exert over systems.'
    - One of the most famous examples of agent based simulations, the [Schellings Segregation Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjfihtGefxk&ab_channel=RandomEconomist), won the Nobel Prize. It has been brought to life by this colorful and interactive animation, [The Parable of the Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/), which makes an intimidating and complex problem ‚Äì racial segregation ‚Äì approachable through metaphor and simple interactivity.
    - Another inspirational simulation, more relevant to our purposes here, [To Build a Better Ballot](https://ncase.me/ballot/), explores alternative voting methods for the US presidential election. Similarly to our simulation here, it sets objective qualities of candidates as a construct to determine how fair and democratic are the election outcomes.
